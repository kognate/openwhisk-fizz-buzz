I walked into the conference room the company had set up for my interview and smiled at everyone present.  After a bit of small talk the tech lead said "Your first problem is FizzBuzz".

"No problem", I said, "I've even implemented FBAAS -- FizzBuzz as a service so I can just point you at the URL and set you up with a free account."  

I didn't get the job.  And to add insult to injury it seems that very few people are
willing to pay $99/mo for FizzBuzz as a service.  I'd been asked to implement
it so many times that knew the demand was there.   While demand is there,  I just wasn't able
to convert the numbers needed to keep going with the service.

You loyal fans are not going to be abandoned: the service is being open sourced.
This repo contains everything you need to run your own copy of FBaaS for all of
your technical interviewing needs.  Best of all, the service is built on top of OpenWhisk,
which means it runs as a completely serverless service allowing you to run it
very inexpensively and you can scale pretty much infinitely.  




Thank your for coming with me on this amazing journey.
